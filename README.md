# UVA-Orientiation-2023-JDU
## TL;DR
Place for materials that I have gathered or learned during UVA's MSDS Orientation 2023

## Description
Hello, and welcome to this page. This is a place for information, materials, and other stuff that I have gathered during The University of Virginia's orietation for the School of Data Science (2023). This technical orientation is run by Professor Alonzi from UVA to expose all UVA MSDS students to Git, GitHub, and other code-based materials.
