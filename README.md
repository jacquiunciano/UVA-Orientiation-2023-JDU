# UVA-Orientiation-2023-JDU
## TL;DR
Place for materials that I have gathered or learned during UVA's MSDS Orientation 2023

## Description
Hello, and welcome to this page. This is a place for information, materials, and other stuff that I have gathered during The University of Virginia's orietation for the School of Data Science (2023). This technical orientation is run by Professor Alonzi from UVA to expose all UVA MSDS students to Git, GitHub, and other code-based materials.

## Table of Contents
1. Materials List for GitHub Badge
2. Materials List for VS Code
3. Materials List for Python

## Materials List: GitHub Badge
1. First lesson was learning how to fork a repository (repo) from another source. The forked repo was sourced from Prof. Alonzi's Star Wars ranking repo, which can be accessed [here](http://alonzi.github.io/star_wars_power_rankings). I also added to the repo and issued a pull request so that the change can be approved/incorporated into the "main" repo.
2. A popular reading in this orientation is [Code Review Guidelines for Humans](https://phauer.com/2018/code-review-guidelines/). I enjoyed how to touched upon how the reivewer should treat the reviewee such as using I-messages and making sure the reviewee doesn't feel attacked and embraces learning. Prof. Alonzi wants us to especially commit to being humble and asking for help when we need it (don't be stubborn!).
3. Next task was to read about [higher order features](https://github.com/features) on GitHub. I read about Security and Team Admisitration on GitHub and talked about these features with a friend.
4. The three repos that I visited where:
     - [ord](https://github.com/ordinals/ord); also nice but I didn't really learn a lot when I read the readme
     - [ChatGPT.nvim](https://github.com/jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim); looked nice but could've had a table of contents or something because there was a lot on there
     - [openai cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook); LOVED the way this was organised, simple, readable
5. I visited the following GitHub profiles:
     - [Prof. Alonzi](https://github.com/alonzi)
     - [Prof. Evans](https://github.com/evansuva)
     - [Prof. Sherriff](https://github.com/marksherriff)
     - [Aman Shrivastava](https://github.com/4m4n5)
     - [Zanwen Chen](https://github.com/zhanwenchen)
     - [Hao Tian](https://github.com/Haotian9850)
6. With this next line, I'm writing in VS Code and pushing this change back to GitHub.
